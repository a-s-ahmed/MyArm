Group Members: Dawood Ali, Amro Amanuddein, Me (Ahmed S. Ahmed), and Portia Rayner

Create a lasercut robotic arm which can remotely emulate your own

The physical arm itself is actually the MeArm (https://www.instructables.com/id/Pocket-Sized-Robot-Arm-meArm-V04/) which we lasercut and assembled for the competition. Massive shout out to Dejan author of the article "Arduino and MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope Tutorial" (https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-and-mpu6050-accelerometer-and-gyroscope-tutorial/) which showcases a way to use the accelerometer to create a gimbal with the mpu6050. This project does have some similarities with other hand-motion controlled robotic arms however the code we based this initial design off of is the one in Dejan's article as well as this article about how to use the mpu6050 (https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MPU-6050/#short).
