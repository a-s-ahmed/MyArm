# MyArm
Create a 3D-printed robotic arm which can remotely emulate your own

Use multiple ardafruit playground expresses and an mpu6050 accelerometer to track the motion of your arm and then wirelessly transmit that to the arm using transcievers. The Arm itself is actually the MeArm (https://www.instructables.com/id/Pocket-Sized-Robot-Arm-meArm-V04/) equipped with a transceiver to receive the instructions for the playground express.
